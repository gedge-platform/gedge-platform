***
GEdge-Platform is a cloud edge computing platform for ultra low-latency services at the edge of the network.

It can supports ultra-responsive service experiences by rapidly processing massive data at the edge without delays in processing and transmission to central cloud.
For the Edge AI service, it provides real-time, distribued, high-reliability and cost-optimal AI computing support at the edge through the cloud edge collaboration, cluster management and intelligent scheduling of multi-tier clusters.
